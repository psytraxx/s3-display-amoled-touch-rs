# T-Display-S3 AMOLED Plus

This repository contains the Rust example application for the LilyGo T-Display-S3 AMOLED Plus development board. It integrates the display driver and system-level functionality to showcase how to build and deploy applications using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller with the onboard AMOLED display, touch controller, and power management.

## Overview

The project demonstrates:

- High-performance display control using the RM67162 AMOLED controller.
- Touch input handling via the CST816S touch controller.
- Power management monitoring with the BQ25896 PMU.
- Application-level UI components built with Slint for a seamless embedded GUI experience.

For details on the low-level driver implementations, please refer to the corresponding driver documentation.
